# Python

This repository contains part of my Python projects:

- [voiceGPT](/voiceGPT)
	+ Programming with Python for Raspberry Pi, utilizing a speaker and microphone to convert speech into text. The program utilizes an API interface to connect text with OpenAI's ChatGPT and ultimately converts the response back into speech.
